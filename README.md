This dataset is an extention of the Pheme dataset found under:
[https://www.pheme.eu/2016/06/13/pheme-rumour-dataset-support-certainty-and-evidentiality/]
The dataset contains two main folders similar to the original dataset, (en) for English tweets and (de) for German tweets. These folders are 
further divided similar to the original dataset by news-story (for example: "germanwings-crash").
In the original dataset, each news-story is divided into number-threads. This dataset contains folders inside each news-story with the same numbering
as the original dataset. The json files in these numbered folders contain all crawled tweets from the user that tweeted the "source-tweet" in the 
original dataset.
